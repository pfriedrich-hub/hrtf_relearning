def rec2ir(recording, reference):
    """
    Compute an impulse response (IR) from a recorded playback of a known reference signal.

    The function performs deconvolution of a recorded sweep or test signal with its
    corresponding reference signal to obtain the system's impulse response. It also
    applies regularization, time alignment, windowing, and low/high-frequency extrapolation
    to produce a clean, time-limited IR suitable for further HRTF or room-response analysis.

    Steps
    -----
        1. Ensure both signals share the same sampling rate (resample reference if needed).
        2. Convert both signals to `pyfar.Signal` objects and DC-remove them.
        3. Compute the inverse (regularized) spectrum of the reference signal.
        4. Deconvolve the recording with this inverted spectrum to obtain a preliminary IR.
        5. Identify the earliest main peak across channels as temporal reference.
        6. Apply a rectangular time window around this peak to remove reflections.
        7. Zero-pad the IR back to original length.
        8. Split the response at 400 Hz using a 4th-order crossover:
        - low-frequency component: delay-aligned and extrapolated
        - high-frequency component: taken from windowed IR
        9. Combine low- and high-frequency components and crop to 256 samples.
        10. Return as a `slab.Filter` FIR filter.

    Parameters
    ----------
        recording : slab.Binaural | slab.Filter | pyfar.Signal
        Recorded signal of the playback (e.g., measured sweep or system response).
        reference : slab.Filter | pyfar.Signal
        Original excitation signal used for playback (e.g., sweep).

    Returns
    -------
        slab.Filter
        FIR filter containing the cleaned, windowed impulse response.
        The returned object has shape (n_samples, 2) for binaural data.

    Notes
    -----
        - The function assumes two-channel (binaural) data but works for mono as well.
        - The time window around the main peak is currently fixed to (n0−50, n0+100).
        - Regularization limits are hard-coded to 20–18 750 Hz.
        - The output IR is cropped to 256 samples; adjust as needed for longer tails.
